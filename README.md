# where-is-waldo

## Description

[Odin] Image tagging app using the visual puzzle format of "Where is Waldo?".

_Where's Waldo?_ is a series of book that popularized the intricated super detailed illustration style. This application shows one of these images and allows users to interact with it in order to seek and find some recognizible characters, as well as compete with each other in a Highscores board.

The illustration is authored by the amazing artist [Laurie Greasly](https://twitter.com/lauriegreasley).

## Objectives & Outcomes

- Interact with a NoSQL flexible database.

- Design an interesting application with smooth transitions and animations.

- Understand and integrate a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) provider in Firebase into the app.

- Familiarize with Firebase's services, in particular Cloud Firestore.

- Further improve React proficiency in functional components using Hooks.

## Development

### Javascript Framework

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

### Libraries, extensions and tools

- [Firebase's Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) - Scalable, flexible NoSQL database for web, mobile and server development.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - A linter tool to standardize code
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Code formatter
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - Hosting

## Future works

As on any project, there are always more things that I would like to implement that didn't make it to the final version you see live. This section lists a few of them for future me to pickup and add them.

- Main menu page with introduction, basic instructions, image selection and direct acess to highscores.

- Add the rest of "The Raid" illustration collection by the artist. See [The Raid](https://www.reddit.com/r/wimmelbilder/comments/9eeub4/the_raid_by_josan_gonzalez_and_laurie_greasley/) and [The Raid 2: Incident of line 13](https://www.reddit.com/r/wimmelbilder/comments/9y2uni/the_raid_2_incident_on_line_13_by_josan_gonzalez/)

- Add credits somewhere (both to the Artists and to myself)

- Refactor sidebar to Read from the .json file

- Lift up the game logic and state to a more appropriate component
